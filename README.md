Fruit Prediction using Pretrained CNN Model

We use a pre-trained CNN models to classify fruits as per desired and correct classes

We make use of VGG16.

We set our model for training and iterate through batches to generate predictions and calculate the loss associated with them as well.

The file VGG.ipynb has the finalised code and outputs.
